# QuadClaude Logo Design Brief

## Project Overview

**App Name:** QuadClaude
**Tagline:** Multi-terminal workspace for Claude
**Platform:** macOS desktop application (Electron)

---

## What Is QuadClaude?

QuadClaude is a developer productivity tool that lets users run **four simultaneous Claude AI terminal sessions** in a single unified window. Think of it as "Zoom for Claude" — users can view their AI conversations in different layouts (2x2 grid, focus mode, split view, etc.) and switch between them instantly.

### Core Concepts
- **Four terminals** running in parallel
- **Grid-based layouts** (2x2 quadrants is the signature view)
- **Claude AI** integration (Anthropic's AI assistant)
- **Terminal/CLI aesthetic** — this is a power-user developer tool
- **Workspace persistence** — remembers your setup between sessions

## Target Audience

| Persona | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Power Developers** | Use Claude across multiple projects simultaneously (frontend, backend, testing, docs) |
| **Researchers** | Compare Claude's responses side-by-side, test different prompts |
| **Multitaskers** | Juggle multiple AI conversations throughout the day |

**Key traits:** Technical, productivity-focused, appreciate minimalist design, spend hours in terminals

## Visual Identity & Design Direction

### Current App Aesthetic

The app uses a **terminal-inspired, monospace aesthetic** with subtle warmth:

| Element | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Background** | `#1a1a1a` | Deep charcoal, almost black |
| **Foreground** | `#d4d4d4` | Soft off-white text |
| **Accent Color** | `#D4A59A` | "Claude Pink" — warm terracotta/rose |
| **Borders** | `#3c3c3c` | Subtle dark gray |
| **Muted Text** | `#6b6b6b` | For secondary elements |

### UI Style
The interface uses **ASCII-art inspired elements**:
- Buttons appear as `[2x2]`, `[clear]`, `[swap]`, `[⚙]`
- Layout indicators: `───` dividers
- State indicators: `[*]` for active, `[·]` for idle
- Monospace typography throughout

### Mood
- **Professional** — this is a serious developer tool, not playful
- **Minimal** — clean, no visual clutter
- **Technical** — terminal/code aesthetic
- **Warm** — the pink accent prevents it from feeling cold or sterile
- **Sophisticated** — premium feel for power users

## Logo Design Direction

### Concept Ideas to Explore

1. **The Quadrant**
   - Four squares/terminals in a 2x2 grid formation
   - Could be abstracted or literal
   - Represents the core "quad" functionality

2. **Terminal + Grid Fusion**
   - Combine terminal cursor/prompt elements with grid layout
   - `>_` or `$` integrated with quadrant shapes

3. **The Letter Q**
   - Stylized "Q" for "Quad"
   - Could incorporate grid/four-section concept within the letterform

4. **Window Panes**
   - Four window/pane shapes suggesting the multi-terminal view
   - Could have subtle perspective or depth

5. **ASCII Art Inspiration**
   - Logo that could theoretically be rendered in ASCII
   - Box-drawing characters: `┌─┬─┐ │ │ │ ├─┼─┤ │ │ │ └─┴─┘`

### Visual Elements to Consider
- The 2x2 grid is the **signature layout** — strongly associated with the product
- One quadrant could be "highlighted" (like focus mode) with the pink accent
- Clean geometric shapes work well with the terminal aesthetic
- Should work at small sizes (menu bar icon, favicon, app icon)

### Color Usage
- **Primary:** Use the Claude Pink (`#D4A59A`) as the main brand color
- **Secondary:** Deep charcoal background (`#1a1a1a`) or pure black
- **Mono version:** Should work in single color (pink on dark, or white on dark)

## Technical Requirements

### Sizes Needed
| Use Case | Dimensions | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| macOS App Icon | 1024x1024 (master) | Will be scaled down automatically |
| Menu Bar Icon | 22x22 @1x, 44x44 @2x | Simplified/mono version |
| Favicon | 32x32, 16x16 | For future web presence |
| Social/Marketing | 512x512+ | GitHub, promotional |

### Format Deliverables
- Vector source (AI, SVG, or Figma)
- PNG exports at required sizes
- macOS `.icns` file (or assets to generate one)
- Dark background version (primary)
- Light background version (for light mode)
- Monochrome version

---

## Inspiration & References

### Related Visual Territory
- Terminal emulators (iTerm2, Hyper, Warp)
- Developer tools (VS Code, JetBrains, GitHub)
- Grid/layout tools (Figma, Linear)
- The original Claude brand (Anthropic's warm, approachable aesthetic)

### Avoid
- Overly playful or cartoonish
- Generic AI imagery (robots, brains, circuit boards)
- Busy or complex designs that don't scale down
- Cold, purely techy blue/green color schemes

## Name Breakdown

**Quad** + **Claude**

- **Quad** = Four (4 terminals, quadrants, 2x2 grid)
- **Claude** = Anthropic's AI assistant (the thing running in each terminal)

The name emphasizes multiplicity and the signature four-pane layout.

## Summary

Create a logo that:
1. Evokes "four" or "quadrants" visually
2. Feels like a premium developer tool
3. Uses the warm terracotta/rose accent color
4. Works on dark backgrounds primarily
5. Scales well from app icon to tiny menu bar icon
6. Has a clean, minimal, slightly technical aesthetic
